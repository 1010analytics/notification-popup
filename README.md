### Animated Notification System

This project is a dynamic React.js notification system that provides an attractive and user-friendly way to keep users informed without disrupting their experience. It includes pre-defined success and error notifications, as well as customizable generic notifications with a close button for manual dismissal. The notifications appear with smooth animations and disappear automatically or on user action.
